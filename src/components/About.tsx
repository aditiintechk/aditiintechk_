			<h3>ABOUT</h3>
			<p>
				From a young age, I discovered my passion for programming when I
				built an <strong>elections portal</strong> for my school in 8th
				grade. This interest guided me to pursue a degree in computer
				science engineering, where I actively participated in hackathons
				and <strong>interned at Spotalpha</strong>, an AI-based
				portfolio management platform.
			</p>
			<p className='description'>
				During my final year, I secured an internship that transitioned
				into a role as an SAP developer, a position I have held for the
				past five years. Throughout my career, I have continuously
				nurtured my love for programming. Over the last two years, I
				have <strong>focused on learning web development</strong> and
				have built websites to enhance my portfolio.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am now seeking a position in front-end development to make a
				meaningful impact in the web industry.
